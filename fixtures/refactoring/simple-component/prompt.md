You are a Vue.js expert. Refactor the following component to add TypeScript type safety.

Requirements:
- Add `lang="ts"` to script tag
- Define an interface named `HelloWorldProps` for props with proper types
- Use `defineProps<HelloWorldProps>()` syntax
- Maintain exact same functionality
- Keep template unchanged

Original code:
```vue
{{original_code}}
```

Output ONLY the complete refactored component code, no explanations.
